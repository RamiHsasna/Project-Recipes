# Project-Recipes

This project is designed to code a website that contains a list of my favorite recipes accompanied with a guide on the ingredients of the recipe and the steps of preparing it.

I hope you enjoy this simple design as it is one of my first ever web design projects and I will be looking forward to any feedbacks that I can implement.
